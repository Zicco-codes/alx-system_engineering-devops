# Web Stack Debugging Project

## Description

This project is a part of the Web Stack Debugging series, which aims to provide hands-on experience with debugging issues in web server setups. In this specific project, the task is to debug and fix an issue with an Apache server running inside a Docker container not returning the expected content when queried.

## Task Description

In this task, you are provided with a Docker container in which an Apache server is running. However, when querying the root of the Apache server, it does not return the expected "Hello Holberton" page. Your objective is to debug the issue and fix it so that the Apache server serves the correct content when queried at the root.

## Requirements

- Docker (if you want to experiment locally)
